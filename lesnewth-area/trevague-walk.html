                        I park the car by the ford, just south of Trevage Farmhouse, and then walk back up to the farmhouse and (strange as it may
                        seem) through their garden – to the right of the house as you look at it – and up over the granite
                        stepping stones in the hedge. Once over the hedge, we can turn left and follow the edge of four fields
                        before coming to a gate at the start of the fifth which leads us into a high hedged lane and into
                        the hamlet of Tregrenna.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../assets/images/lesnewth-area/trevague-1.JPG" width="100%;" alt="" />
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Turning left, we walk down the road and over the bridge. The stream that we cross over here, is the head of the River Lynher,
                        which will cross again later, in fact we are barely a mile from its source. We continue up the hill
                        a short distance before undertaking the most arduous section of this walk. We need to go up over
                        the very steep stile in the hedge on our left. Once over we cross the field diagonally to our left
                        again (it is a circular walk) and then straight through the farm that is in front of us. Here, the
                        path is not well marked, but the lady of the farm is extremely pleasant and has always helped point
                        us in the right direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Across the field and passing a new(ish) build on our right and passing a tree which has, on every occasion that I have walked
                        this, have a pottery Mallard at its base. Just passed the tree, we tread over a little tributary
                        and up into a small copse of trees, and follow this path back to a road. If we were to turn left
                        here, we would pass over the ford by which we have parked (using the very lovely footbridge). However,
                        today we are going to head off to the right and up the road for a short distance before crossing
                        over another stile and in to a small woodland of conifer trees. At the end of the woodland, we exit
                        over another stile, which puts us into another small stream and on a wide path which leads us along
                        the edges of East Moor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The path comes to an end, at a gate – one on our left and one directly ahead of us. We are going to take the gate to the
                        left, but I marvel each time that the house in front of us is numbered 32. Where are the other 31?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once in the field to our left we walk down and diagonally to our left, where at the foot of the field we find a wooden footbridge
                        taking us again over the River Lynher. We are now briefly in Upton Woods, and to our right are the
                        remains of Upton Castle. Through the gate we come into a wide field with a most gorgeous solitary
                        Holly Tree, which we are going to pass on our left. Into the next field, we are going to walk up
                        towards the farm, but beware the final gate can be a little boggy where all the cattle go through!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once in the track, turn right and into the yard, where the footpath passes alongside one of the cattle barns, and then back
                        into open field. A third of the way along the top side of this field, the path crosses into the higher
                        field running alongside, before passing into a third field (which very often has sheep in – dog owners
                        please be responsible) and finally out onto the road again.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../assets/images/lesnewth-area/trevague-2.JPG" width="100%;" alt="" />
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        From here, it is a short walk down the road (left once we get onto it) back to our car. If we haven`t already had a look,
                        take time to cross the granite footbridge across the ford, and try to picture how the area has changed.
                        When my family were first here (several hundred years ago) there was a mill on the lower side of
                        the ford, there was a village green as well as the woodland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a special area for me, and this walk can be done as a whole, two small circular walks or as a figure of eight if
                        you want to mix it up. Now you are here, remember the East Moor over which we have skirted. Even
                        on a busy bank holiday, when everyone is on North Moor and heading for Brown Willy, the East Moor
                        can be eerily quiet if you want some solitude.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In doing this walk I always end up asking myself why is there a solitary house on the edges of the moor, with such a high
                        house number, I also ask myself (and yet have no answer) what is the significance of the name of
                        Upton. It appears all over Cornwall and again here. Maybe you know?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope that you enjoy.
